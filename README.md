# player-monitoring

This project is a web application that allows users to monitor football players. The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The backend of the application is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. The data is stored in MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database.

The application allows users to view player statistics, such as goals scored, assists, and minutes played. Users can also view player profiles and search for players by name or team. The application also includes an admin panel that allows administrators to add new players and update player information.
